title: The very first anemia case
date: 2017-02-07
description: >-
  A 85 yo woman presents with a random Hb of 6.4 gr/dL which was discovered incidentally on a routine CBC. She has a history of DM type II, CKD stage III, CABG 5 years earlier, and bilateral femoral artery stenoses albeit with palpable femoral pulses. She appears pale, breathing normally with no chest pain and mentions a recent fall for which she hasn't received any medical attention. Upon further inquiry you elicit a baseline Hb concentration of 9 gr/dL being supported by monthly darbepoetin alfa administration.
