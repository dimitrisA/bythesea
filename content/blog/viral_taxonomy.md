<h2>DNA Virsuses</h2>

Generally: ds DNA, icosahedral symmetry, replicate in the nucleus (where DNA is normally found). Of them:

1. Three viruses are naked. Papova, Adeno, Parvo ("Woman naked for PAP smear exam").
2. Parvo is so simple it has a single DNA strand. SS Linear DNA. It's also naked hence simple. "One Par Golf".
3. "Pox in a box". Pox has complex symmetry, complex envelope. Replicates in the cytoplasm.

<h2> RNA viruses</h2>

Generally: ss stranded, helical capsid symmetry, replicate in the cytoplasm

1. Reo are double stranded. "Oreo cookies have cream in between". DS segmented. "Think broken=segmented oreo cookies".
2. Calici, Reo, Picorna are naked. "A Calici dancer in Rio with a Pico.... "
3. Calici, Reo, Picorna, Flavi, Toga. "A flavorful toga joins them in Rio". They all have icosahedral symmetry.
4. (+) stranded. Think an arena (Arenaviridae) with Paul Bunyon (Bunya) that uses a rhabdo=rod (Rhabdo) to fight, Orthomyxo, Paramyxo and their friend Filo (filos=friend)
  * Arena, Bunya, Rhabdo, Orthomyxo, Paramyxo, Filo
5. (-) stranded. The Caclified old Emperor Pico spilled Flavorful Corona on his Retro Toga.
  * Calici, Picorna, Flavi, Corona, Retro, Toga
